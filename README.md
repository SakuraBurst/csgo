# 🛑 VAC

Since the system is still WIP, I haven't tried it yet, but I haven't VAC banned yet with the system that I have done with Python and is very similar to this system. Nevertheless, use it at the risk of VAC banning. I do not accept any liability if you are VAC banned. Use at your own risk.

# 🧨 Build your own instance

I suggest you to run cheat directly without building an instance but you can create your own instance by following the steps below.

-   Download GoLang from https://golang.org/
-   Download repository files
-   Run `go mod tidy`
-   Run `go build .`
